      <img src="img/logo/dove.png" alt="..." />
      <p class="green-text text-darken-4">Cate was born in Canada, but has lived in Denmark since 1990, and has been
        married to me since 2014. We live a peaceful life, where we do good towards everyone we meet, and we treat
        everyone equally. We don't go to church. We are awaiting Jesus' second coming. That is to say what some call the
        rapture. We strongly believed that He would come at this year's "Feast of Trumpets". But He did not come to this
        year's "Feast of Trumpets". As a christian we should expect Him every day.</p>
      <p>We have a "King James Bible", you can use <a href="https://dannyandcate.github.io/bible/"

      <h2>Convert</h2>
      <p>
        Many people convert to Jesus these days. They look for a savior, to
        rescue them from this wicked world we live in. If you compare a piece
        of rotting meat, with the sin and wickedness of this world, they both
        share a process that escalates, the more time that passes the worse it
        gets. And it is really bad today.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-aaj-gradient-transparent">
      <h2>Sin & Forgiveness</h2>
      <p>
        Christians often sound like they are judging themselves, and others.
        That's because they let Jesus / God judge them, when they repent from
        something. To be able to repent, there needs to be someone to pay the
        price for trespassing God's laws. Jesus is the perfect man. 100%
        human, and 100% God in one and the same being. It is the Holy Spirit
        that convicts us, and Jesus the spotless Lamb of God, that saves us
        from sin. It says in the Bible, If we confess our sins to Jesus, He is
        faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and cleanse us from all
        unrightrightness.
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1%3A9&version=KJV" target="_blank">1. John 1:9</a>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-aaq-gradient-transparent">
      <h2>Blood & Heart</h2>
      <p>
        Only Jesus' blood can cleanse us, when we repent of our sins from the
        bottom of our heart. Jesus said I am the way, the truth, and the life.
        No one comes to the Father, but by Me.
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A6&version=KJV" target="_blank">John 14:6</a>.
        You can't fool around, when it comes to repenting. You have to
        truly be sorry for what you have done wrong, and you need to turn 180
        degrees, and go the other way. It requires action, and determination
        to repent, ask for forgiveness, and be cleansed.

      <h2>Relationship</h2>
      <p>
        "and [that you may come] to know [practically, through personal
        experience] the love of Christ which far surpasses [mere] knowledge
        [without experience], that you may be filled up [throughout your
        being] to all the fullness of God [so that you may have the richest
        experience of God’s presence in your lives, completely filled and
        flooded with God Himself]".

          3:19</a>.

    <div class="bg-aba-gradient-transparent">
      <h2>Trust</h2>
      <p>
        But without faith it is impossible to [walk with God and] please Him,
        for whoever comes [near] to God must [necessarily] believe that God
        exists and that He rewards those who [earnestly and diligently] seek
        Him.
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb+11%3A6&version=AMP" target="_blank">Heb 11:6</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        As you see, you need to believe that God exist, and that he rewards
        those who seek Him
      </p>
      <p>
        "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not to your own
        understanding; in everything acknowledge Him and He will direct your
        path".

        And finally
        <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A28&version=KJV" target="_blank">Romans 8:28</a>
        says: "And we know that all things work together for good to them that
        love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose".

      <h2>What it takes</h2>
      <p>
        That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
        believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
        shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
        and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
